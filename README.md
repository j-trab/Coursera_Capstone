Cluster analysis on location data referring to the city of Venice, Italy.

Which is the most optimal neighbourhood where to start a restaurant in Venice, Italy? 

In order to answer this question in a commercially viable manner, we applied a __K-Means__ model to two different data collections we obtained via a series of open access sources: one includes variables referring to the popularity of each neighbourhood among tourists, one includes location data we sourced via the _Foursquare_ API.
